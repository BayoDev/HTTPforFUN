# WebFromScratch

This is a hobby project to reimplement some of the basic technologies that make up the internet, no external libraries, and raw C.

This is not meant to be used in any production environment or serious use, most security issues are not addressed and will never be.

This is what I've done so far:

## HTTPserver 
A simple HTTP server written C that aims to be compatible with HTTP/1.0 (RFC 1945) with some tweaks. 

The basics of the server are now working, HEAD/GET methods are implemented (without conditional) and more is on the way.
